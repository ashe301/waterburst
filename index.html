    <p>Dear Owners Committee,</p>
    <p>I'm writing to discuss Motion 5, which has a clause to make individual owners responsible for services, electricity and water lines, in common property.</p>
    <p>However, the result of this would be making individual owners responsible for events or actions occurring on common property, therefore this Motion should not pass with its current wording.</p>
    <p>In late August, VCBS (our old strata manager) sent their corporate preferred trade, Blue Diamond, to diagnose a leak in a pipe, slightly underground at the car-park gate and on common property (which we do not have permissions to alter or repair).</p>
    <p>They ignored Blue Diamond's recommendations to move the pipe away from this location and effected a direct replacement. The water shutoff valve was unused, which wasted drastically more water. No notice or documentation was given.</p>
    <p>We only learned about it when the tenants received a bill of $4000 for the water that flooded the carpark. Our agent quietly negotiated with South East Water to halve the bill to $2,000 and grant an extension until January 8.</p>
    <p>Upon enquiries, VCBS claimed to be ignorant of the tenants' address. After some persistence, they simply presented an invoice for 'Car Park Water Leak' after weeks of effort, which they initially claimed was a plumber's report.</p>
    <p>The agent notified us of the issue in December but said they would deal with it. By late December, we were told by the agent that we must pay the water bill, and Leon received the $6000 debt from the invoice in the transition. He attempted to transfer it to us, as it occurred on a pipe section after our meter.</p>
    <p>We believe Motion 5 is not in owners' interest as the last repair attempt lacked quality. Owners should cover repairs in full for issues beginning in spaces they control, or for items they destroy. But, we cannot have owners being required to pay the full cost of repairs for infrastructure they don't own and cannot control, but leads to them eventually.</p>
    <p>For better clarity, and to avoid future disputes of this nature, I believe Motion 5 should clearly assign responsibility for services located within or under common property to the owners corporation, regardless of whether they serve one or multiple lots.</p>
    <p>Kind Regards,</p>
